# POMDPbetting
**Betting** the optimal way in a card game using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (**POMDP**s).

## Description
In card games, the players do not have full information, and there is randomness.
To play in an optimal way we must use the information we have, and take into account the information we do not have. With a POMDP we can model this simple card betting game and play optimally given the information available to the player.

## Getting Started
This is a simple python notebook. Run the cells sequentially and see the results.
### Dependencies

* Requires Python3.
* Requires the numpy library which can be installed with pip.
